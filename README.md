  ## Description  

  

  An online school for learning auto mechanic work starting from tools to how a car works. The site uses lessons and quizzes to let users asvance as they learn the concepts.  

  * Motivation  

    I have wanted to spread my automotive knowledge to people that need a place to start. This site was the perfect medium to accomplish just that.  

  * Reason for Building  

    I felt the website was a good way to format the knowledge, as well as force users to actually learn the information before moving on to more advanced material by using the quiz system at the end of each lesson.  

  * Problems Solved  

    It teaches tool use and automotive knowledge to people who otherwise may not have access to it from either unsupposrtive figures in their life, gatekeeping hobbyists in their community, or other hurdles created in the automotive enthusiast space from gender, racial, or class inequalities.  

  * Things Learned  

    This was my firstcomplete and functioning full-stack web aplicaton that uses a relational database in SQL, express for the APi routing, handlebard for the template engine, and node to run server side logic. There wre many hurdles with passing data from the front to the back end and back again but it functiones how I imagined it should in my head.

  ## Contributing  

  

  So many people. My wife for supporting my journey to web development. My son for inspiring me to be a better provider. Michael and Teresa Basch for kickstarting my professional career in a great direction. Andrew Ausley, James cooper, and Michael Meeks for development coaching and being a great support group. Chris Tyre, Crit Bennet, and all the OGTA members who helped me learn about how to work on cars.  

  

  ## Tests  

  

  The application definitely needs some cleaning up with the routes in regards to the authentication. I had issues getting the session to save when creating a new account so you have to immediately log in after you create an account. If users want to help diagnose that, it would be great.:)
